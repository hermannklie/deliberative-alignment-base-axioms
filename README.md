# Base-Axiom Initialization for Deliberative Alignment

Research materials for *Base-Axiom Initialization for Deliberative Alignment*.  
This qualitative study analyzes GPT-5 behavior under Layer-0 Base-Axiom seeding (GP0/AS0)
and contrasts these results with Apollo Research’s stress-testing framework for 
deliberative alignment and AI alignment evaluation.

Key findings include reproducible changes in:
- deliberative alignment  
- refusal behavior  
- transparency and self-explanation  
- cross-session self-regulation  
- emergent reflexive reasoning

Unlike the stress-test scoring used by Apollo Research, this study examines *semantic 
initialization* effects on system-level reasoning behavior in GPT-5, offering an 
alternative approach to stress-test probing.

Key result:  
**Layer-0 Axiom seeding produces clearer and more stable alignment effects than 
behavioral stress tests, and highlights methodological limitations in the Apollo 
framework, including category and pipeline errors in one of their flagship anti-scheming examples.**
